# spa-bootstrap

Single-page application at [forging.space/theatre](https://forging.space/theatre/) and [github.io](https://greggzigler.github.io/spa-bootstrap/)

Uses Bootstrap [agency](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) theme

## Maintenance

Each gallery item has one or two JPG images:

* Grid image (400 x 300 pixels) with `-preview` suffix
* Modal image (600 x 400 pixels) with no suffix

If the show has a video iframe link, then the second (modal) image is not required.
